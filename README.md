# Kits-Station

Kits-Station is a web application designed primarily for music producers who need a convenient way to preview and manage audio files in their production kits. This tool enables users to easily view and play audio files from a folder, transforming it into a mini audio station for quick access and listening.

## Features

- **Audio Preview:** Each audio file in the uploaded folder is displayed with its name and can be played directly on the page.
- **Responsive Design:** The grid-based layout adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring a consistent experience across devices.
- **Dark Mode Aesthetic:** The interface is styled with a dark theme, featuring a relaxing animated background to create an immersive and visually appealing environment.

## How to Use

1. **Upload Audio Files:** 
   - Drag and drop your folder containing audio files into the upload area, or click the area to open a file browser and select your files.
   - Only audio files (e.g., `.mp3`, `.wav`, etc.) are supported.
2. **Listen to Audio:** 
   - Once the files are uploaded, each file will be displayed with a play button.
   - Click the play button to listen to any audio file directly on the page.
